# Android-App: "AbkVerz" #

Source code for an Android app (project for *Android Studio*) demonstrating how to use SQLite database for an app to store and search abbreviations.

<br>

Identifiers (names for classes, variables and methods) and UI texts are in German only.

<br>

SQL files for testing with command line program SQLite3 (e.g. *sqlite3.exe* on Windows) can be found in sub-folder [SQL/](SQL). These files will NOT be included into the app file (APK file) generated by *Android Studio*.

See [this repository](https://github.com/MDecker-MobileComputing/Android_AbkVerzMitRoom) for a variant of this app which uses the [Room Persistence Library](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room?hl=lt).
